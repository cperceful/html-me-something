            <p id="intro">So, I love dogs.  Like, a lot.  Now that I don't live with my parents, I technically don't have one of my own. But I think of all of their dogs as my dogs too. Let's talk about them</p>

            <a name="dax"></a>
            <div>
            <h3>Dax</h3>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/dax.jpg" alt="a picture of Dax" style="height: 300px" />
                    <figcaption>This is Dax. Obviously, she is a pug.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="dogbio">She's 8 years old now, almost 9. She's very smart, even though she's had no training of any kind. Use a word with her 3 or 4 times and she understands it. She's my dad's dog, and he spoils her rotten. Also, she's really fat</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <a name="blue"></a>

            <h3>Blue</h3>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/blue.jpg" alt="a picture of Blue" style="height: 300px" />
                    <figcaption>This is Blue. He's a mutt, with a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetick_Coonhound">blue-tick coon hound</a> in him.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="dogbio">He's just about 3 now. He's...not the smartest. He likes to jump on you and lick your face. He loves laser pointers too much. He is my mom and stepdad's dog</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <a name="sadie"></a>
            <h3>Sadie</h3>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/sadie.jpg" alt="a picture of Sadie" style="height:300px" />
                    <figcaption>This is Sadie. She's a mutt, with some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_(dog)">Boxer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bulldog">American Bulldog</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Russell_Terrier">Jack Russel Terrier</a>, and Hound. </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="dogbio">She's almost 10 years old now, and she's a grumpy old lady. She moves a little slower than she used to, and plays a little less. But she'll always be my favorite person. She's technically my mom and stepdad's dog, but everybody agrees that at least emotionally, she's my dog.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
            <h3>Honorable mention: Dany</h3>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/dany.jpg" alt="a picture of Dany" style="height:300px" />
                    <figcaption>Ok, so she's technically not a dog.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="dogbio">But Dany was found in a parking lot by my mom when she was way too young to be seperated from her litter. She's basically been raised by Sadie and Blue. In a lot of ways, she acts more like a dog than a cat. She's pretty cool </p>
